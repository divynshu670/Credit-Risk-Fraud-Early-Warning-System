# Decision Memo: Credit Risk & Fraud Strategy

## Problem
UPI-based credit products face increasing credit defaults and fraud risk
as transaction volume grows.

## Key Insights
- Risk segmentation clearly separates users by behavioral and repayment patterns
- High-risk users contribute disproportionately to defaults
- Night-time usage and repayment delays are strong early risk signals

## Recommendation
- Restrict or manually review High-risk users
- Apply transaction velocity limits for Medium-risk users
- Maintain standard approvals for Low-risk users

## Expected Impact
- Meaningful reduction in defaults based on simulated policy actions
- Limited impact on overall approval rates

## Risks & Trade-offs
- False positives may affect user experience
- Thresholds require calibration over time

## Next Steps
- Validate with live production data
- Introduce real-time monitoring
- Add feedback loop for rule refinement
