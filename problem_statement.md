## Background & Context

Slice offers UPI-based credit products designed for speed, simplicity, and transparency.
As transaction volume grows, the business faces a trade-off between:

- Driving growth via higher approvals
- Controlling fraud and credit losses to protect unit economics

Currently, risk signals are often identified after losses occur.

---

## Core Business Question

How can slice proactively identify risky users and transactions early,
and take targeted actions that reduce losses without hurting growth?

---

## Why This Matters

- Fraud and defaults directly impact profitability
- Over-restrictive rules degrade user experience
- Leadership requires interpretable, data-backed decisions

This project proposes an analytics-driven early-warning system
to support credit and fraud strategy decisions.
